This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust involving mutable and immutable borrows.  The `bug.rs` file contains code that attempts to modify a value through a mutable borrow while also holding an immutable borrow, which is not allowed by the Rust compiler to prevent data races and ensure memory safety. The solution, in `bugSolution.rs`, illustrates how to resolve this conflict by restructuring the code to avoid concurrent borrows.
